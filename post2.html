        <h2>What is the point of console.log? Who am I printing this to?</h2>

        <!-- OK so to get <p></p> to show its &lt;p&gt;&lt;\p&gt; DONT QUESTION IT-->
        <p> HOLY SHIT If I fucking write &lt;p&gt;&lt;\p&gt;, then it just recognizes it as a blank paragraph. I had to look it up and there is some dark fucking magic associated with getting that shown as real text. I'm not going to question it.</p>
