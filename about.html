        <h1><span class="highlight">Its a fucking blog about <s>CSS</s> <s>Javascript</s> ALL FRONTEND what are you expecting here?</span></h1>
        <p>Written while frustrated with <s>css</s> web development</p>
        <p>Why does the crossed out shit in the header not have a background? Probably something to do with a span.</p>
        <p>Also why do they have me using linux? Theres some weird quirks to it. I usually capitalize letters by double tapping caps lock, not by holding shift, and theres a small delay when I do that, so sometimes I accidentally capitalize the first 2 letters and have to go back. Not sure if it's because of xubuntu or its just a Linux thing. Also the main page feels like a very barebones computer from like 2008, which is neat I guess. I figure they use linux because of some sort of superiority complex thing.</p>
        <p>Same thing goes with them wanting me to use the terminal for everything I do in here. mkdir? cd? ls? .? Hackerman.</p>
