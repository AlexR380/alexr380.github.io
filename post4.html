            <h1>I'm tired of this shit not making sense, I'm going to get drunk and update this post as I get drunker, I think that will make it make more sense</h1>
            <h2>One shot in</h2>
            <p>Why did I make h1 that god awful red color? Thats not very good on the eyes. I want to change it but I think doing that might fuck everything else up. I've got like 8 different spans associated with the various h1's on the various pages. How do people write over a thousand lines and then be confident changing anything? What the fuck</p>
            <h2>Two shots in</h2>
            <p>Music. I can code while I listen to music. Thats going to help surely. Is it called coding if it's just HTML and CSS? I dont know a better word for it. HTML'ing. I think I want this hosted on a domain by the end of the week. Maybe with a comment section. That would be neat. Anonymous strangers on the internet commenting horrible things about me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm going to try and change the color from red to something that wont hurt my eyes. Wish me luck.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I fucking did it. I am a goddamn prodigy. An absolute savant. A virtuoso.</p>
            <label for="Synonyms for how great I am">What other synonyms for how amazing I am are there?</label>
            <input type="text">
            <p>Doesn't matter what you type there. Won't get submitted anywhere. I wont see it. I don't know how to do any of that shit.</p>
            <h2>Two shots and one beer</h2>
            <p>It's actually 3 shtos and one beer but I just took the shot so it doesn't count. I got bored and started playing league. I fucking hate Kayle. And nasus, and jinx, and yorick, and tryndamere. Anyone who is just "Make the game last until 25 minutes and im unkillable", its shit game design.</p>
            <h2>Three shots. One beer. An indescribable amount of wine</h2>
            <p>I'm writing this because I dodged a gameo f league and got a six minute timer. I'm going to try and avoid writing about league because this is a blog about programming but fuck league. As I realize this is a blog that can be read by anyone I get more insecure about semantics. Is there a difference between programming and coding? The more I google things the more I feel like a fraud. WIll I ever be able to really make it in this field? I've worked in sales my whole life. I want to get into programming to get into a field that I dont hate. Sales is a commission based field of ups and downs, people absolutly breathing down my neck about useless statistics all day that mean nothing. Did I spell field right? IS it feild? Neither look exactly right. I'm on column 786 according to cs vode. Do I start a new paragraph wrapper? I'm gonna try. </p>
            <p>I'm just ranting until my league timer is up. Does this feeling of, whats the word, brb google. Imposter syndrome is the word. Does that go away? I look up everything I have to do. But I also googled imposter syndrome and that felt fine, googling the right words to say is fine, so is googling the write code to write okay? Is it just googling all the way down? Does anyone actually know how to code or are we just stealing code in some sort of not infinite but unmeasurable loop back? My league timer is done. See you a few drinks deeper.</p>
